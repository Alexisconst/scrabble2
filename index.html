					Since the dawn of humanity, human being has sought to communicate, to gather, to find a language to accomplish his work. But he is also moved by forces that tear him apart, by processes created by his fellows to divide the species. Scrabble is the allegory of the paradoxes that animate us. Fighting in a merciless fight of at least 20 minutes, whose weapons are the letters of our alphabet. The logic of the Union never leaves the Scrabble game. The words must connect, while widening the gap of points between the opponents.
